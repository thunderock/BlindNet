Object classification is one of the core problem in computer vision. In real world the objects share a relationship with the surrounding. In this project, we attempt to use deep learning techniques to evaluate if a deep learning model can learn the relationship between the object and scene. We attempt to make a deep learning model learn to infer the object from the surrounding. We perform few experiments all of which try to capture this essence some way or the other.
